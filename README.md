# Norrinspiration

This app allows the user to fetch jokes from from [Chuck Norris API](https://api.chucknorris.io/). The user can add or delete a joke to the list of favorite jokes, every time a joke is liked, it is saved to the local database.

This app uses HotWire to dynamically load the sections and jokes from the API and display them on the screen.

It was developed using TDD, and is fully translatable to spanish (i18n).

- ERD: The ERD diagram that represents the database is the following:
